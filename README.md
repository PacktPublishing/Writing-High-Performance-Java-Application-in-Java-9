# Writing High Performance Java Application in Java 9 [Video]

This is the code repository for [Writing High Performance Java Application in Java 9 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/writing-high-performance-java-application-java-9-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788474993), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course

    A lot of applications that are built today need to handle huge amounts of traffic in low latency. Java is a very popular language and JVM is a popular platform to build high performance programs in Java. Java 9 adds reactive programming as a first class citizen to handle traffic in a multi-threaded and concurrent way. Writing high-performance concurrent and thread-safe programs is hard, but you’ll discover how and see what Java 9 adds to the software engineer toolkit.





First, we’ll create efficient lock-free programs that leverage the multi-core architecture of the CPU using the newest Java 9 features. Then you’ll see how Java Memory Model affects the performance of your programs. You’ll discover why it’s even more important to be aware of the software-hardware co-operation of your programs in Java 9. 





Moving on, you’ll find out how to leverage constructs from JAVA 9 java.util.concurrent to create efficient multi-threaded programs. We’ll explore the different kinds of locking available in JAVA 9 and get to know when you should use which kind of locks. Finally, you’ll see what tools are shipped with the JDK 9 and know how to use them properly.
